ðŸ“„ Project Report: Live Code Editor

1. Project Title

Live Code Editor with Realtime Collaboration



2. Introduction

This project is a collaborative live code editor built using React, Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and MongoDB.
It allows multiple users to join a shared room and write, edit, and execute code in real-time with instant synchronization across all connected clients.


3. Objectives

To build a real-time collaborative code editor.

To allow users to run code in multiple programming languages.

To display connected users in each room.

To provide a simple and interactive user interface.



4. Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js, CodeMirror, Monaco Editor

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Realtime Communication: Socket.IO

Database: MongoDB (for room and user management)

Other Tools: GitHub, GitHub Pages (for hosting frontend)



5. Features

Create and join rooms with unique IDs.

Real-time collaborative editing using Socket.IO.

Support for multiple languages: JavaScript, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, SQL.

Code execution with instant output.

Displays list of connected users.

Switch between CodeMirror and Monaco editor.

Live preview for HTML/CSS/JS code.


6. System Architecture

Frontend (React): Provides editor, output panel, and user interface.

Backend (Express + Node): Handles API requests and code execution.

Socket.IO: Manages real-time code synchronization and user events.

Database (MongoDB): Stores user and room data.


7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of real-time communication with collaborative programming.
It provides an efficient platform for group coding sessions, teaching, and peer learning.
Future enhancements may include authentication, version control, and cloud-based code execution for enhanced scalability.








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
