Live Code Editor
________________________________________
Introduction
The Live Code Editor is a collaborative platform that enables multiple users to write, edit, and preview code in real time. It provides instant updates across all connected clients, making it suitable for pair programming, coding interviews, and collaborative learning.
________________________________________
Project Objectives
â€¢	Develop a real-time collaborative code editor.
â€¢	Support multiple users joining and leaving rooms.
â€¢	Provide instant synchronization of code across all users.
â€¢	Allow live preview of written code.
â€¢	Ensure smooth user experience with notifications (join/leave).
________________________________________
Technology Stack
â€¢	Frontend: React.js, CodeMirror, Monaco Editor, React Hot Toast
â€¢	Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
â€¢	Styling: CSS, Tailwind
â€¢	Tools: WebSockets for real-time communication
________________________________________
System Features
â€¢	User can create or join a room using a unique Room ID.
â€¢	Connected users are displayed in the sidebar.
â€¢	Users receive notifications when others join or leave.
â€¢	Live code preview updates instantly as the user types.
â€¢	Option to switch between Monaco and CodeMirror editors.
â€¢	Room code is persisted so new users see existing code upon joining.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a real-time collaborative coding platform. It is useful for developers, students, and educators to collaborate and learn together. Future enhancements may include syntax error highlighting, multi-file support, and integration with cloud storage for persistent project saving.














# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
